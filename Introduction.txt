###  What is EcoMine?

**EcoMine** is an end-to-end deep learning platform built to **mine, analyze, and visualize ecological science literature** from JSTOR’s Constellate dataset. It extracts valuable information—like species names, locations, methods, and datasets—from unstructured research articles and turns them into a **searchable, summarized, and interactive** knowledge base.

Built with advanced **NLP models** (e.g., SciBERT, BioBERT, T5) and a modular architecture, EcoMine supports **semantic search**, **text classification**, **named entity recognition**, and **auto-summarization**—all accessible through a clean, web-based dashboard.

###  Why Was EcoMine Created?

Despite the explosion of ecological research, much of it is buried in **PDFs, prose, and static text**, making it:
- Hard to search
- Difficult to summarize
- Impossible to analyze at scale

Researchers, conservationists, and policymakers often lack the tools to:
- Discover patterns in ecological monitoring
- Compare methods across studies
- Identify under-studied species or regions
- Reuse existing datasets

EcoMine was built to **bridge this gap** using AI—**automating literature mining** and transforming academic text into **structured, queryable knowledge**.

###  What Does It Do?

EcoMine follows a robust **4-tier architecture**:

| Tier | Function |
|------|----------|
| **1️⃣ Data Collection** | Ingests metadata and full text from JSTOR’s Constellate |
| **2️⃣ NLP Processing** | Applies deep learning models for NER, classification, and summarization |
| **3️⃣ Knowledge Structuring** | Stores extracted info in PostgreSQL with vector embeddings |
| **4️⃣ User Interface** | Offers an interactive dashboard with search, filters, and Q&A |
